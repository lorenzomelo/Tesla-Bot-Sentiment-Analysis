# Tesla-Bot-Sentiment-Analysis

Technology is widely considered the main source of economic progress, but it has also generated cultural anxiety throughout history. 
From generation to generation, literature has often portrayed technology as alien, incomprehensible, increasingly powerful and threatening, and possibly uncontrollable. 

In this context, our study aims to run a sentiment analysis that will help us understand the current feelings of people towards the emergence of new technologies, hidden in their tweets. As a proxy for this new technologies we chose the Tesla-Bot, a humanoid robot designed and developed to perform tedious everyday tasks or dangerous jobs such as manual labour. Tesla says the robot is being proposed as a “non-automotive robotic” — meaning it will operate through artificial intelligence — and will function through the company’s advanced neural network, the same that help Tesla vehicles navigate through roads and streets without human assistance. 

We want to emphasize that, since the Tesla-Bot has not been commercialized yet, the results of the sentiment analysis will not return some kind of customers satisfaction, but rather the feelings of people towards the occurrence of an event that, in the specific case, reflects a future in which physical work won’t be required anymore. After all, Elon Musk itself was quoted as saying he thinks the Tesla Bots will be “quite profound” and foresees physical work being only a choice for humans in the future. “If you want to do it, you can,” he said, “but you won’t need to do it.”
